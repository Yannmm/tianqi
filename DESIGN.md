## Thoughts

1. 3 tabs. I think "4 tabs" design is a little bit redeuntant. first tab should be dashboard, which contains 
- a brief summary of expense (of this year).
- car name
- expense list by timeline
- each expense item should be allowed user to attach one or more image.

second tabs hould be "analytics" or history. user can view expensese in calendar view or table view. compare expense by month/year/day. view expense in category.

last tab is "more" or "settings". user can be notified view this page (or insert notification in calendar. export data as csv or insert data in calendar)

2. add expense workflow:

1. refuel
  - time
  - location (nearest gas station)
  - litre
  - total price
  - price per litre



# This app should support multiple cars

# Add tab when adding expense (like refuelling(92, 95, 98), repair etc.)
